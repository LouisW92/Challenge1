# Challenge1

## Description

This project is an on-the-job-ticket which aims to improve the accessibility of the Horiseon Search Engine Optimization applcation. This project also aims to resolve some coding errors, improve the semantic element structure, and help to 'clean up' the code in accordance with the Scout Rule.
I learned a lot during this process, particularly in the use of classes, id's, elements and benefit of semantic elements.
